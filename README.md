# Netflinks

This is the tool I use to create NLs (pdf documents containing images and links) for my friends.

But it's also my QA sandbox project (beginnings with Playwright, diÃ¡taxis documentation, ...).

For the moment, I execute this project locally (no docker, no login / pwd, ...).

## Origin

Netflix + Links = Netflinks

- Composer ([ðŸ”—](https://getcomposer.org/download/))
